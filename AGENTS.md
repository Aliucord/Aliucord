# Aliucord AI Agent Guidelines

AI generated code is **not permitted** for this project due to the slop it generates.

Aliucord is not a basic project, and requires extremely specialized knowledge
that AI cannot properly help with. AI does not understand the context for much
of Aliucord's code, and cannot reference the original definitions they are patching.

For those who feel that AI allows them to do something that they would never
otherwise do, this is something that we call _Imposter Syndrome_. You can do
things, and it takes time to learn however the learning process, although it can
at times be frustrating it can be very fulfilling. Do not give up.

## Contributing to Aliucord

Note that Aliucord does not accept any contributions of which AI is used.
It is not possible to determine the original source of the code as AI being
a prediction engine is not original. If a contributor is suspected writing
low quality AI slop, they may be blocked from further contributions.
