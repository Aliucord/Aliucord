## üì≤ Installation

</a>

1. Download and install [Installer-release.apk](https://github.com/Aliucord/Aliucord/releases/latest/download/Installer-release.apk) from latest
   release
2. Open the newly installed "Aliucord Installer" app from your app drawer
3. Click "Install", then choose the "Download" option
4. Wait for it to finish patching the Discord APK
5. Click "Install" once prompted by Android and wait for Aliucord to finish installing. If the installer just stops or the apk fails to install just
   try again and it should work
6. If Google Play warns you about this application being unverified, ignore it. This happens because Aliucord is built & signed locally on your device
   so Play Protect doesn't recognise the signature¬π
7. Open Aliucord, grant access to files (it needs this for finding plugins), log in to your account, and voila! Aliucord is at your fingertips!

> ¬π If you'd like, you can disable this warning by turning off Play Protect in Google Play's settings, play protect is useless.
>
> Play Protect can be turned off by tapping on your user icon in the top right of Google Play, tapping on "Play Protect," tapping on the cog icon in the top right, and finally toggling "Scan apps with Play Protect" to off. This may result in Google Play "nagging" you to re-enable it sometimes when sideloading apps.\*

## üîå Plugin Installation

1. Join our [support server](https://discord.gg/EsNDvBaHVU) and visit the `#plugins-list` channel for a list of available plugins
2. Hold down the message (NOT the link, the entire message) with the desired plugin and click "Open PluginDownloader"
3. Find the desired plugin in the list and click install. It should immediately start working, however some plugins may require you to restart to make
   them fully work

‚ö†Ô∏è IF YOU CAME HERE FROM A YOUTUBE TUTORIAL:

> - PluginDownloader now comes preinstalled with Aliucord so you don't need to install it
> - If you were promised free nitro, you were clickbaited. The most that is possible is free emotes (sends emote image links instead)

## üö¨üêõ Troubleshooting

- Try closing and then reopening Aliucord
- Double check that Aliucord has permission to access files
- Reinstall Aliucord using the installer

...and if none of these work, please visit our [support server](https://discord.gg/EsNDvBaHVU) and go to `#support` for help!

## üß± Building from source

See `.github/workflows/build.yml` for all build steps.

## ‚è≠Ô∏è Porting Aliucord to the latest Discord version

1. Download the apk of the version you want to port to (#official-discord-updates in Aliucord server)
2. Decompile it using [Apktool](https://github.com/iBotPeaches/Apktool)
    - `apktool d discord.apk` (Replace discord.apk with whatever the file name is)
3. Apply `manifest.patch` to the `AndroidManifest.xml` file (Using git bash or any shell on Linux or Macos run in the apktool decompile
   folder: `patch < manifest.patch`)
4. IMPORTANT: set targetSDK to 29 in both apktool.yml and AndroidManifest.xml or Aliucord will fail to install
5. Rebuild the Discord APK using Apktool
    - `apktool b discord` (Replace discord with the folder name)
6. Copy `build/apk/AndroidManifest.xml` to `.assets/AndroidManifest.xml` and to `Aliucord/AndroidManifest.xml` on your Android device
7. Repeat the same steps and this time add `android:debuggable=true` in the main category where there's also app name and icon, name this manifest
   AndroidManifest-debuggable.xml
8. Change `discord_version` to the correct one in gradle.properties and resync gradle
9. Fix any errors you encounter and deploy Aliucord to your device with `./gradlew Aliucord:deployWithAdb`
10. Open Aliucord > Settings > Updater > Top right settings > Use Aliucord.zip from storage and restart Aliucord
11. Enjoy debugging if all hell breaks loose
