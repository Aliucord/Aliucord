Aliucord is a modification for the Android Discord app inspired by desktop client modifications.
</p>
<p align="center">
Unlike other Android Discord app modifications, you don't need to rebuild the APK when adding or removing plugins, because Aliucord hooks at runtime using the <a href="https://github.com/canyie/pine">Pine</a> java method hook framework.
</p>

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Information

### Supported Architectures

- `arm`
- `arm64`

Pine does not support `x86` or `x86_64` architectures, and thus Aliucord does not either.

### Supported Android version(s)

- 7.0+ (SDK 24+)

### Supported Discord version(s)

- 96.3 / Beta 96103 (You don't need the apk, the installer will download it for you)

## üé® Features

- Rootless! Aliucord itself does not require a rooted device in order to use it
- Robust plugin system using Pine!
    - Allows swapping in and out your plugins without needing to rebuild Aliucord
    - Toggle on and off, configure or uninstall your plugins via the plugins page
    - Minimum Discord versions for plugins so no breaking changes are sent out to outdated Discord versions
- In-app updater to keep Aliucord and your plugins up-to-date
- Crash logging!
    - In-app crash log page to give a more native feel
    - Logs are also saved to `Aliucord/crashlogs` for easy access outside of the app

## üì≤ Installation

</a>

1. Download and install [Installer-release.apk](https://github.com/Aliucord/Aliucord/raw/builds/Installer-release.apk) from the `builds` branch
2. Open the newly installed "Aliucord Installer" app from your app drawer
3. Click "Install", then choose the "Download" option
4. Wait for it to finish patching the Discord APK
5. Click "Install" once prompted by Android and wait for Aliucord to finish installing.
   If the installer just stops or the apk fails to install just try again and it should work
6. If Google Play warns you about this application being unverified, ignore it. This happens because Aliucord is built & signed locally on your device 
   so Play Protect doesn't recognise the signature¬π
7. Open Aliucord, grant access to files (it needs this for finding plugins), log in to your account, and voila! Aliucord is at your fingertips!

> ¬π If you'd like, you can disable this warning by turning off Play Protect in Google Play's settings, play protect is useless.
> 
> Play Protect can be turned off by tapping on your user icon in the top right of Google Play, tapping on "Play Protect," tapping on the cog icon in the top right, and finally toggling "Scan apps with Play Protect" to off. This may result in Google Play "nagging" you to re-enable it sometimes when sideloading apps.*


## üîå Plugin Installation

1. Join our [support server](https://discord.gg/EsNDvBaHVU) and visit the `#plugins-list` channel for a list of available plugins
2. Hold down the message (NOT the link, the entire message) with the desired plugin and click "Open PluginDownloader"
3. Find the desired plugin in the list and click install. It should immediately start working, however some plugins may require you to restart to make them fully work

## üêõ Troubleshooting

- Try closing and then reopening Aliucord
- Double check that Aliucord has permission to access files
- Reinstall Aliucord using the installer

...and if none of these work, please visit our [support server](https://discord.gg/EsNDvBaHVU) and go to `#support` for help!
