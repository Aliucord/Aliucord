# Aliucord
Discord Android app mod inspired by desktop Discord client mods. Unlike other mods, you don't need to rebuild the apk on PC, because Aliucord is hooking at runtime using the [Pine](https://github.com/canyie/pine) hook framework.

âš  **Info**: Aliucord doesn't support `x86` and `x86_64` architectures, because Pine supports `arm` and `arm64` only.

**Supported Android versions**: 7.0 or higher (sdk 24)

**Supported Discord version**: 79.1 - Alpha (79201)
